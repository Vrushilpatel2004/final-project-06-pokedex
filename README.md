## PROJECT ABSTRACT


We all know what Pokemon is, and most of us might know what a Pokédex is. It is an encyclopedia focused on providing information on the world of Pokémon, from creatures’ biology to their base stats used in battle. In this project, I would like to replicate the Pokédex that we see in the anime and games of Pokémon. This project will have beautiful and no bloat on the page to quickly identify which Pokemon you want in your team! It allows for user authenticaion and sign-in to retain their previous tracked teams, create new teams, and view all information about every single Pokemon in generations 1-9. If you aren't leveraging the Team Battle Builder feature, once again, it still functions perfectly fine to query and learn more about Pokemon that you're interested in.
